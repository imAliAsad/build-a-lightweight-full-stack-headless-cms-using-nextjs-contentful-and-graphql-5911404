With the growing popularity and widespread use of headless architecture in web development, it is important for web developers to stay ahead of the industry curve. Headless architecture keeps the frontend lightweight and more optimized. In this course, software engineer and educator Dakota Fabro guides you through building for clients who prefer to use a CMS with their websites so that you can provide solutions that are lightweight and intuitive. Learn to use Next.js, Contentful, and GraphQL to create a site that uses headless architecture. Then complete a capstone project to help you practice what you’ve learned in the course. By the end of this course, you will be able to build and maintain headless web projects, and you’ll be able to apply the skills and knowledge acquired from this course in your current or aspirational role.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
